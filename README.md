Club Fez website

## Running (deploying to server)
The club fez website is made using a *backend* so it can not run using static hosting.

1. add API_KEY.json as google api key (if its already there, you're good to go)
2. deploy to a server that can run the app using `npm start`

## Running (locally)
1. Download the code
2. Open it in a Terminal
3. Type `npm install` and then `npm start`
